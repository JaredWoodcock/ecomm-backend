# EComm Backend
Module 13 Challenge - ECommerce Backend

In this challenge, I finished the code for an E-Commerce website's back end that met the following criteria:
<ul>When the database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password are added to an environment variable file, then the user is able to connect to a database using Sequelize.</ul>
<ul>When schema and seed commands are entered, then a development database is created and is seeded with test data.</ul>
<ul>When the user enters the command to invoke the application, then the server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.</ul>
<ul>When API GET routes are opened in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags, then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.</ul>
<ul>When the user tests API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia, then the user is able to successfully create, update, and delete data in the database.</ul>
